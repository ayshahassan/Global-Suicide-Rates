# Global-Suicide-Rates
Analysis of global suicide rates over the years 1985 - 2016 using Python. This project is part of the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry.

## Overview
The dataset chosen for this project provides information on suicide rates on a global level. As per the World Health Organization's (WHO) website, more than than 700 000 people die by suicide every year. Furthermore, for each suicide, there are more than 20 suicide attempts.

## Objective 
To develop insights for suicide prevention. Suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect that impacts on families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies. Suicides are preventable. Much can be done to prevent suicide at individual, community and national levels. 

## Key Questions
In this analysis, we've explored the reasons behind global suicide rates. In addition to this, observations around geographical areas where suicide rate is the highest/lowest and demographic factors such as age group, gender, generation in which suicide is most common have been also been done based on the following key questions:
* What patterns can we see with regards to total number of suicides over the years?
* Are suicides rates climbing or falling in various countries? What do suicides by country over the years look like?
* What are the ten countries with highest and lowest suicide rates?
* What variables (such as gender or age) can you find that might correlate to suicide rates?
* What are the major factors behind suicides? Low gdp per capita, from a certain generation group, mental health reasons, etc?

## Data Collection
* The data for this project is an open source data downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016?select=master.csv).  

As this is a complied dataset, it has been pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place which are as follows:

* United Nations Development Program. (2018). Human development index (HDI). Retrieved from [UNDP](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506).
* World Bank. (2018). World development indicators: GDP (current US$) by country:1985 to 2016. Retrieved from [World Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/world-development-indicators#).
* [Szamil]. (2017). Suicide in the Twenty-First Century [dataset]. Retrieved from [Szamil](https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/suicide-in-the-twenty-first-century/notebook).
